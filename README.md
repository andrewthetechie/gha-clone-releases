<!-- action-docs-description -->
## Description

Clone the releases in one repo to this one


<!-- action-docs-description -->

This github action can clone releases from a source repo to your repo. This is useful if you are using a repo to build container
images for an upstream container. You can run this action on a cron schedule to pick up new releases and build new containers.

## Usage

On each run, it will find all releases in `repo` and the repo you are running your action on, find any releases that exist in `repo` and not in your repo, and then will create those releases in your repo.

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: Clone
on:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run action
        # Put your action repo here
        uses: andrewthetechie/gha-clone-releases@v1
        # Put an example of your mandatory inputs here
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repo: andrewthetechie/andrewthetechie:
```
